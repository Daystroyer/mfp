  <p>Hi, and welcome to this website. I am the Author of the book series called <strong>Weapon Wars</strong>, and creator of this website.
    Let me tell you a bit about myself. I started writing the Weapon Wars when I was 11 years old. As for web development, I started when I was 12.
    This website is one of the many websites I built when I was 12.</p>
