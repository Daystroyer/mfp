    <h3>Prologue</h3>
  <p>She looked into the darkness. There were two choices, run or hide. As she was
    trying to decide, an ear-splitting roar pierced the air. An abandoned shop was
    to her left and a train station to her right. As a train came to a stop she
    bolted toward the train and hid her baby under a pile of blankets. Suddenly,
    the train started to move and the whistle blew. “ I love you,” she said, her
    voice as an angel. She ran off the train and was gone. As the mother ran to
    her car she saw a dragon approaching. She started the car but froze. It fel
    t like being trapped in an iceberg. She pushed the pedal to the floor and
    swerved right and then darkness overcame her vision.</p>

  <p>Chris woke up as beads of sweat dripped down his forehead. No one else was
    awake in the house, he looked at the grandfather clock. It read 6:50. As he
    looked to his right Bella shifted in her sleep. Bella Grace was a beautiful
    girl that lived in the orphanage with Chris. She has dazzling blue eyes and
    chestnut hair. The morning bell rang, had he really been sitting there for 40
    minutes. As he threw off his sheets a cold, bone shattering voice came from
    the depths of his mind. “I will find you, and when I do, you will be another
    prisoner, just like your mother. You and your friend have a great magic greater
    than anything I have detected. Beware.” As the voice stopped he heard Bella
    calling his name. “ Chris, hello. Chris to earth are you there.” <br>“Ya, sorry.” <br>
    As they headed to the dining hall the smell of eggs, bacon, ham and buttered toast.
    He grabbed a tray and got in line. There were about 30 orphans in the orphanage.
    All of which had no living relatives, and we're all talking to their neighbors.
    <br>

    Chris grabbed his food and went to sit beside Bella. “What do you think Mr.
    Kirt is going to teach us today,” Bella said.<br>
    “Probably how to stutter.” <br>
    “Ha-ha very funny, what happened in the sleeping chambers,”she asked. “You were
    in some kind of deep trance” “ I heard a voice speaking to me, He said that he
    would turn me into another one of his living dead servants,”said Chris. Bella’s face
    turned serious, and she stood up and said “I have to go to the bathroom.” Then
    leaving her tray where it was, she stood up and walked out of the cafeteria.
    <br>
    After school they went to the sleeping chambers. Bella was reading her school
    text book, and Chris was reorganizing his locker ( which was full of trash and
    ripped notebooks.) As he walked to the trash can he saw Bella stand up and walk away.
    Chris ran over to the trash can, dropped his stuff in it, shut his locker, and
    hurried after her. When he finally found her she was talking to someone. As he
    edged toward the window he saw a hologram of a centaur coming from a coin resting on the
    desk. What was a centaur doing talking to Bella? Why was the centaur even here?
    As Chris walked back to the sleeping chambers he heard someone calling his name.
    It was Mr. Smith, and he looked worried. “ Mr. Hill wants you lad,” said Mr. Smith.
    “ And you better watch how you talk to him, he is in a pretty bad mood.” Why would
    Mr. Hill want him at this hour of the day? “ Tell him I’ll be right there. I have
    to talk to someone first,” said Chris. He hurried to the chambers and looked
    around to find bella. She was back on her bed reading her ELA book. Bella
    looked up from her book and said, “ You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
    “Well I’m going to see something worse, and his name is Mr. Hill,” said chris.
    “ And I had better hurry or he’ll have my head.” Bella stood up and said, “ Then go,
    I don’t want to go to your funeral.” He hurried out the chambers and looked at the
    stone walls. When Chris approached Mr. Hill's door he knocked. “ Enter,” came Mr.
    Hill's voice. “ Ah, Chris I’m glad you came, follow me.” They walked out of his
    office and stopped at the end of the hall. Mr. Hill pushed two buttons on the
    stone wall that Chris had never noticed before. Mr. Hill spoke words that
    sounded like gibberish and suddenly, instead of stone there was a door.
